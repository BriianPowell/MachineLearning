I have include three .py files which contain each of the architectures you've requested as well as a jupyter notebook which shows everything I've done all in one place.
I used tensorflow-gpu version 1.10 and the most recent version of keras to run each architecture.

**Question:** (25 points) What are the test accuracies and training times for the above three classifiers?

1. For the first architecture I received the following scores accuracies and times:

```
Test loss: 0.09484220381788909
Test accuracy: 0.9718
```

2. For the second architecture i received the following scores for accuracies and times:

```
Test loss: 0.05111734776184894
Test accuracy: 0.9833
```

3. For the third architecture I received the following scores for accuracies and times:

```
Test loss: 0.04702326302188448
Test accuracy: 0.9832
```

All of these results can be viewed in both the Arch_#.py files I've included in the .zip as well as in the Jupyter Notebook.
